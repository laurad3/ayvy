    So successfully<br>
    We have broken new ground<br>
    We have seen that it’s done for us<br>

    <p>
    Unconstrained<br>
    I’ll show how it’s done<br>
    Keeper’s principle<br>
    Let’s assume that you are one<br>
    I’ve seen miracles<br>
    Long before you came<br>
    And reserved the slums for bitter men<br>

    Who is the villain in this story of mine?<br>
    Who is the villain in this story of mine?<br>

    We’re someone’s goons<br>
    We don’t really mind what it takes<br>
    Dirty tricks and crazy fits<br>
    As we’re raising the stakes<br>
    We fraternize and we compromise<br>
    The price of making our way<br>
    Just like today<br>
    Only better<br>

    Makers of fun<br>
    She smiles, just like everyone<br>
    Keep in mind<br>
    We wander into the eye of the storm<br>
    The warning, oracle one<br>
    Let me know if you can<br>
    </p>
    <p>
