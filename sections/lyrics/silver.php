    <h2 class="lyrics__title">Silver Sulfur</h2>
    <p>
    This is something unreal<br>
    I've become what you said I would<br>
    Seconds turn into years<br>
    Make me blush<br>
    Make me rush for you<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    We'll leave it alone<br>
    You'll come around<br>
    We'll leave it alone<br>
    My underscore<br>
    We belong in a silent room<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Silver and gold<br>
    Nothing tends to last<br>
    Back to the start<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And if I fall apart<br>
    Glue me on<br>
    Though if I fall apart<br>
    Your world gets better<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Old sulfur in your hands<br>
    Light me up<br>
    Discomfort imminent<br>
    I hope you'll consider<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Here's my favorite part<br>
    Humming myself to bed<br>
    Hundreds more<br>
    With nothing to be said<br>
    Turning to a prayer<br>
    Slowly blazed away<br>
    Back to the start<br>
    </p>
